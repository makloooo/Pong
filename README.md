# Pong Squared
A small replication of the classic game 'Pong' in order to familiarize with SFML 2.3 and Visual Studio 2015.

The original concept of the game was created by somebody else, whom I cannot reference to anymore due to the 
original creator's name and project being forever lost to the depths of the internet. The entirety of the code is original
and programmed with little to no understanding of how game structure works other than the absolute basics.

The game itself is a replication of the arcade classic 'Pong', except every time a ball collides with a paddle, a second
ball is spawned from the paddle. It will eventually get very chaotic. 

The CPU AI is actually very unfair. It changes movement relative to the closest ball from itself, so it may be unbeatable.

The game currently supports two players:

Player 1 - W, S keys

Player 2 - Up, Down keys

Menu - Enter to Select
